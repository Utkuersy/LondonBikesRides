# 🚴 London Bike Rides Analysis

## 📌 About the Project
This project analyzes London's bike-sharing data to uncover trends, usage patterns, and factors affecting bike rentals. Using **Python**, **Pandas**, and **Machine Learning**, the project explores how weather conditions, time of day, and seasonality impact bike usage.

## 📊 Technologies Used
- **Python** – Core programming language
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data manipulation and preprocessing
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Scikit-Learn** – Machine learning models for prediction
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive analysis environment

## 🔍 Project Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifies trends in bike usage
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Examines daily, weekly, and seasonal rental patterns
- **Weather Impact Study**: Analyzes how weather affects bike demand
- **Predictive Modeling**: Uses machine learning to forecast bike rentals
- **Geospatial Mapping**: Visualizes bike stations and ride density across London

## 🚀 Installation & Usage
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Utkuersy/LondonBikesRides.git
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run Jupyter Notebook** (for data exploration and modeling):
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. **Execute Python Scripts** (for automated data processing and model training):
   ```sh
   python scripts/data_cleaning.py
   python scripts/train_model.py
   ```

## 📊 Key Insights
- **Peak Usage Hours**: Most rides occur during commuting hours (8-10 AM & 5-7 PM)
- **Weather Influence**: Rainy and cold days significantly reduce bike usage
- **Weekend vs. Weekday Trends**: Weekday rides are mostly commuter-driven, while weekend rides are more recreational
- **Seasonal Variations**: Bike rentals peak during summer and drop in winter
